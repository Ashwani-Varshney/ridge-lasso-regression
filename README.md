# Ridge and Lasso Regression
### Problem Statement

1. Take 10  data points (x, y), where y = f(x)+err. Take f(x) as quadratic.
2. Fit linear model and plot the line. Find bias and variance.
3. Fit 3  higher order polynomials  ( 3, 7, 11) . Plot  each model and find B & V
4. At this point you have 4 different models for the 10 points, and their B/V.
5. Now apply ridge regression, plot the curve and show B&V on the plot.
6. Take lambda .0001, .01, 1, 10 and 100.
7. Do the same exercise with Lasso.
